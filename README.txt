1. src directory has two sub directories: kruskal and Dijkstra
2. To run the Dijkstra algorithm, run dijkstra.py by giving the filename that needs to be execute. variable 'filename' has been initialized at the beginning of the line. Give the filename with the proper path and run the code.
3. To run the kruskal algorithm, run kruskal.py by giving the filename with its path to the variable 'filename' initialized at the beginning of the code.
4. Sample input files have been given for each algorithm in its directory. You can use those files to run the code.
5. For Dijkstra algorithm, if source is not given, it will ask to enter the source.
